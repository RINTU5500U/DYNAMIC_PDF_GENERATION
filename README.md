# USED CASES
<< 1ST OF ALL I HAVE EXPERIENCED IN [ HTML, CSS, PYTHON, JAVASCRIPT, NODE.JS, EXPRESS.JS, MONGODB, REACT, AWS (S3, EC2...), REDIS, GITHUB, CI/CD PIPELINE, DOCKER ]
<< SO THE THING IS LANGUAGE AND FRAMEWORK AS WELL AS DATABSES ARE LIKE A PIECE OF CAKE FOR EVERY DEVELOPER 
<< IT MEANS IF WE CAN DO A THING THEN WE CAN LEARN OR ACHIEVE MANY THINGS LIKE THAT AND I AM ALSO PASSIONATE FOR LEARN NEW TECHNOLOGIES

    1. In this assignment i have used <Node.js> as language instead of <Java>
    2. Here i have used <pdfkit> library which is a most popular package for creating dynamic pdf 
    3. Test with postman and working properly
<< FOR MORE INFORMATION I HAVE ATTACH MY RESUME FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION.

    Thank you for valueable time I am always reachable on my email and phone number.

# Assignment: Dynamic PDF Generation
 Build a Spring Boot Application with REST API to generate PDF using Java Template Engine.
# Requirement
● REST API to accept data and generate a PDF based on the received data.
● Ability to download the above-generated PDF
Use Java Template Engines like Thymeleaf or iText to generate the PDF and store it on
the local storage which can be retrieved later. The input should have a proper schema.

Example
The request body of the API call looks something like this:

    {
        "seller": "XYZ Pvt. Ltd.",
        "sellerGstin": "29AABBCCDD121ZD",
        "sellerAddress": "New Delhi, India",
        "buyer": "Vedant Computers",
        "buyerGstin": "29AABBCCDD131ZD",
        "buyerAddress": "New Delhi, India",
        "items": [
            {
                "name": "Product 1",
                "quantity": "12 Nos",
                "rate": 123.00,
                "amount": 1476.00
            }
        ]
    }   

This should generate a single-page PDF as below:

Note
● Only REST APIs are required. No UI.
● Testable on Postman / Swagger.
● Will prefer properly structured code.
● Will prefer Test Cases (TDD).
